This compressed file contains four tables containing data elements for the RADx-rad Data Hub. The tables 
contain pre-filled data based on the information available to the CDx LIMS system. The tables are provided 
to the user to fill in the missing information. Please note that you need to maintain the same format as 
the one provided in the tables (CSV file format, with identical columns and rows).

The three provided tables are as follows:

1. <report_name>_samples.csv
2. <report_name>_samples_results.csv
3. <report_name>_<purpose>.csv
3. <report_name>_batches.csv

The first table contains one row per sample with general information about each sample. 

The second table contains one row per sample result, providing information about the results obtained for 
each sample by the user, including the readout, measurement units, used technology, etc. 

The third table contains one row per panel and provides information about the aggregated results obtained 
after the tests were performed. The <purpose> can be either "LOD", "Challenge" or "Variants" depending on the 
type of panel used. 

The fourth table contains one row per batch included in the panel and provides information about these 
batches: features describing the virus features as its lineage, reference gene taken into account to measure 
concentration, etc.
