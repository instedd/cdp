This compressed file contains three tables containing data elements for the RADx-rad Data Hub. The tables 
contain pre-filled data based on the information available to the CDx LIMS system. The tables are provided 
to the user to fill in the missing information. Please note that you need to maintain the same format as 
the one provided in the tables (CSV file format, with identical columns and rows).

The three provided tables are as follows:

1. <report_name>_samples.csv
2. <report_name>_samples_results.csv
3. <report_name>_<purpose>.csv

The first table contains one row per sample with general information about each sample. 

The second table contains one row per sample result, providing information about the results obtained for 
each sample by the user, including the readout, measurement units, used technology, etc. 

The third table contains one row per panel and provides information about the aggregated results obtained 
after the tests were performed. The <purpose> can be either "LOD" or "Challenge" depending on the type of
test performed. 

Once the developer completes the missing data, these files are ready to be submitted to the RADx-rad 
Data Core (https://www.radxrad.org/) for quality assurance. For more information, please contact 
Dr. Peter Rose (pwrose.ucsd@gmail.com). The Data Core administrator will review the data for completeness 
and consistency and will reach out to the developer if any issues arise.

After the data passes the quality check, the Data Core administrator uploads the data files, common data 
element dictionaries, and metadata files to the NIH COVID RADx-rad Data Hub (https://radx-hub.nih.gov/).
